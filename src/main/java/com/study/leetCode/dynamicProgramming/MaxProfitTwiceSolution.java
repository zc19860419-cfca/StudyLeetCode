 * @Description: 123. 买卖股票的最佳时机 III
 * 你最多可以完成 两笔 交易。
 * 注意: 你不能同时参与多笔交易（你必须在再次购买前出售掉之前的股票）。
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
 * on day i.
 * <p>
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two
 * transactions.
 * <p>
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you
 * must sell the stock before you buy again).
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit =
 * 3-0 = 3.
 *              Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), prof
 * it = 4-1 = 3.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit =
 * 5-1 = 4.
 *              Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them lat
 * er, as you are
 *              engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell be
 * fore buying again.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
