 * @Description: Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
 * on day i.
 * <p>
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many tran
 * sactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple tim
 * es).
 * <p>
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you
 * must sell the stock before you buy again).
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit =
 * 5-1 = 4.
 *              Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), prof
 * it = 6-3 = 3.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit =
 * 5-1 = 4.
 *              Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them lat
 * er, as you are
 *              engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell be
 * fore buying again.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
